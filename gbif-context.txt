GBIF public dataset consists of the bigquery-public-data.gbif.occurrences
BigQuery table (also called the occurrences table), which captures metadata on
crowd sourced observations. Most users will want to filter by
occurrencestatus=PRESENT, as there are also observations reporting absences.

The column names in the GBIF occurrences table follow the Darwin Core standard,
described by https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/.

Specifically, the columns "kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family",
"genus", and "species" refer to terms in a taxonomy hierarchy, with "kingdom"
on top and "species" on the bottom. Any Python, Javascript, or other
programming language software to use the table should use hierarchical data
structures to represent these values, rather than individual variables for each
term.

The number of occurrences (e.g. rows in the table) should not be confused with
the number of individuals - or sums from the "individualcount" column.
