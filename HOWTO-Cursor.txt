This codebase is entirely developed using Cursor, with AI doing all of the programming.

To enable Cursor to access the GBIF BigQuery database, use this MCP server

https://github.com/ANewProfile/gbif-bigquery-mcp

Ignore the README.md file from that repo for now. After you git clone, you will
need to install it using `npm run build`. Then configure it into Cursor from
the Settings>MCP menu, with this

(note you will need to have a service account key file setup, for Google Cloud)

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbif-bigquery": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "gbif-bigquery-mcp/dist/index.js",
        "--project-id",
        "your-profit-id",
        "--key-file",
        "~/.config/gcloud/gbif_service_account_key.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Additionally, it is helpful to provide gbif-context.txt to Cursor as a context,
using the "Add Context" button.
