This codebase is entirely developed using Cursor, with AI doing all of the programming.

To enable Cursor to access the GBIF BigQuery database, use this MCP server

https://github.com/ANewProfile/gbif-bigquery-mcp

And configure it into Cursor like this

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbif-bigquery": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/benjie/git/gbif-ai/gbif-bigquery-mcp/dist/index.js",
        "--project-id",
        "gbif-data-if-i-can-get-it",
        "--key-file",
        "/Users/benjie/.config/gcloud/gbif_service_account_key.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Additionally, it is helpful to provide gbif-context.txt to Cursor as a context,
using the "Add Context" button.
